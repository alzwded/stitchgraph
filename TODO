- add !pragmas:
  - [x] !attention
    - insert some sort of exclamation point in between attentioned stitches
  - [x] !yarn-change
    - same as attention, but with color
  - [x] !pm
    - place marker; add some sort of marker glyph (vertical line between stitches?)
  - !align-left
    - force alignment left instead of center
    - for edge support
  - !align-right
    - force alignment right instead of center
    - for edge support
  - !align-center
    - reset alignment to center
- on normal direction lines, stitch colors e.g. Xss are not reversed, so they end up showing wrong; those need to be renumbered based on the prototype as well (near std::reverse)
- !markers get confused around blanks, `cc` gets skipped before they have a chance to get positioned correctly
