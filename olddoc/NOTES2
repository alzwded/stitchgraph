there are stitches:
    they may "put" (on current row)
    they may "take" (from row below)
    the "put" may have a marker
    the puts and takes may have connecting lines
    they will all appear same height

    special cases:
    - M1 (m1l/m1r) connects in between dots below (put 1, take 0, has line)
    - - (blank) - no vis, propagates current dot up (shared)
    - pu - half line going up (TBD, this might just be - )

line colors:
    black: normal
    blue: behind (for dec's)
    green: new one (for inc's)
    red: for specials

connecting lines:
    connect Nth src to Nth dst relative to where you start the thing
    the special value INBETWEEN is before the taken stitch (or before the stitch which would be taken, if any; i.e. Tfs is before the taken stitch, ml is taken after the last taken stitch)
    if the stitch below is a reference (was a blank previously) then connect ALL the way to the referenced original stitch

parser:
    line ::= label? stitch_orders? end_of_line? comment? /[\n]/ ;
    label ::= /^[^:]*/ ':' ;
    end_of_line ::= 'j'
                  | 'return'
                  | 'turn' ;
    comment ::= '#' /.*/ ;
    stitch_orders ::= '(' stitch_orders ')' count
                    | '[' stitch_orders ']' count
                    | '*' stitch_orders '*' count
                    | stitches
                    ;
    stitches ::= stitch + exclaim? ;
    stitch ::= exclaim? name count? ;
    exclaim ::= /![^ ]*/ ;

then, if current line takes less than prev line,
    on j or return, flood fill with '-' or 'pu'
    on turn, flood fill with N 'pu' followed by N 'pu' on next line

    stitch count should...n't include blanks? but include explicit PUs?

then,
    traverse dots and create connections
        there needs to be a dot reference class for PU's for the force part to work...

then,
    compute force and determine amount of padding/shift (may be a multiple of 0.5 blocks)
    the force per stitch is the amount offset from its lines, averaged
        e.g. a take 2 put 1 will want to be between the 2 takes, that's its target

then,
    commence drawing
        on drawing into a blank/shared dot, make line go to "seed" (many lines below, possibly)


new line types:
    slashed lines (1, 2 or 3)
    no no no, may add glyph to line :-D

    short line is a special thing (draw only half)
